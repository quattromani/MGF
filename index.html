    <h3>In Loving Memory Michael T Goffredo 1986 – 2009</h3>

    <p class="lede">The Michael Goffredo Foundation was established for drug abuse education and prevention. Additionally, since Michael left this life on Thanksgiving Day, was a chef in training and had a wonderful giving heart, the foundation will also feed the hungry on Thanksgiving in his memory. Michael was happiest helping others and his Foundation will keep his kindness and generosity alive forever.</p>
